_Dataland_ is a new block-based programming language designed to help middle and high-school-aged students learn and do data analysis and visualization. _Dataland_ aims to foster data literacies in children by enabling them to write computer programs that analyze and visualize data that connect to their personal interests.

_Dataland_ is being developed as a research project at the [School of Information and Library Science](https://sils.unc.edu/), University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
