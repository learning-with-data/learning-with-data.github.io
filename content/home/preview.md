_Dataland_ is being developed as a set of distinct "microworlds," and currently has two microworlds, the _maps_ microworld and the _plots_ microworld. Each microworld offers a unique set of visualization possibilities, keeping the core programming grammar and the query language the same. For example, the maps microworld provides a set of programming primitives (e.g., `set latitude of map marker to __`) that allow for creating geographical visualizations. The plots microworld swaps out the map-related visualization primitives for cartesian-plot-related primitives (e.g., `set ‘x’ of plot marker to __`). This potentially allows for interest-driven and creative explorations with data that are also constrained to better scaffold the experiences of early-stage learners.

__Please note that the version of _Dataland_ available from this site may change significantly without any advance notice. If you are planning this for use in your classroom or similar contexts, please reach out to us at <sdg1@uw.edu>.__
