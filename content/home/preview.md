_Dataland_ is being developed as a set of distinct "microworlds". Each microworld offers a unique set of visualization possibilities, keeping the core programming grammar and the query language the same. For example, the maps microworld provides a set of programming primitives (e.g., `set latitude of map marker to __`) that allow for creating geographical visualizations. The plots microworld swaps out the map-related visualization primitives for cartesian-plot-related primitives (e.g., `set ‘x’ of plot marker to __`). This potentially allows for interest-driven and creative explorations with data that are also constrained to better scaffold the experiences of early-stage learners.

__Please note that _Dataland_ is very much work-in-progress. The software might change significantly without any advance notice. Please do not use it in a classroom or to create projects that you might want to edit or use later.__
